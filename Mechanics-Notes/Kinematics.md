## Kinematics

## Four Equations

$$\Delta x = v_0t + \frac12at^2$$

$$\Delta v = v_0 +at$$

$$v^2 = v_0^2 + 2ax$$

$$\Delta x = (\frac{v_0+v}{2})t$$

## Types of Motion

### Projectile Motion

You need to separate into x and y components

Use the y to find time, x to find distance

### Relative Motion

$$v_{CB} = v_{CA} + v_{AB}$$ 

Galilean tansformaiton of velocity

### Uniform Circular Motion

$$v = \frac{2\pi R}{T}$$

Acceleration is always changing because the direction changes.
