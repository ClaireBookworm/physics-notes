# Work and Energy

### Work

$$\int F\,d = \Delta k$$

Work is the change of energy over a distance. 

### Power

$$P_{avg} = \frac{W}{t} = \frac{F_x}{t}$$

$$P_{instant} = \frac{dW}{dt} = Fv$$

Power is the rate of doing work over time.

## Kinetic Energy

The energy it possesses due to motion, $$KE = \frac12 mv^2$$

Rotation: $$\frac{1}{2}I\omega^2$$

## Potential Energy

$$F = -\frac{dU}{dx}$$, and $$\Delta U = -\displaystyle\int_{x_1}^{x_2} F_c\,dx$$

$$U_{spring} = \frac12kx^2$$

**Equilibrium point**: F = 0, extrema point

**Stable equilibrium**: U at minumum

**Unstable equilibrium**: U at maximum
