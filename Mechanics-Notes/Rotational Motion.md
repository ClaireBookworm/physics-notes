# Rotational Motion

## Angular Motion

$$\theta=\frac{s}{r}$$, $$\omega = \frac{v}{r}$$, $$\alpha = \frac{a_t}{r}$$, $$\alpha_t = r\sqrt{\alpha^2 + \omega^4}$$, $$a_c = \omega^2r$$ <-- centripetal acceleration

<u>*Rolling constraint*</u>: $$v = r\omega$$, and $$v_{CM} = \frac{2\pi R}{T}$$ 

**Kinetic Rolling Energy**: $$\frac12 I \omega^2 + \frac12 mv^2$$

### Torque

**Torque**: $$\tau = r \times F = rF\sin\theta = I\alpha$$

gravitational torque: $$\tau_{grav} = -Mgx_{cm}$$ 

There is the constant Torque Model --> for objects in which net torque is constant:

- Model object as a rigid body with constant angular acceleration
- **Newton's Second Law**: $$\tau = I\alpha$$

### Rotation About a Center of Mass

$$x_{CM} = \frac1M \Sigma m_ix_i = \frac{m_1x_1 + m_2x_2...}{m_1+m_2...}$$ 

The center of mass is the mass-weighted center of the object. 

You can also find it through **integration** of the x and y directions. 

### Moment of Inertia

$$I = \Sigma mr^2$$, the sum of all particles = $$\int r^2\,\,dm$$ 

*Parallel Axis Theorem*: $$I = I_{CM} + Mh^2$$ 

| Value                      | Equation              |
| -------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Solid Sphere               | $$\frac25mr^2$$       |
| Rod Center                 | $$\frac{1}{12} ml^2$$ |
| Rod End                    | $$\frac13ml^2$$       |
| Hollow Hoop (through axis) | $$mr^2$$              |
| Solid Disk (through axis)  | $$\frac12mr^2$$       |
| Hollow Sphere              | $$\frac23mr^2$$       |

**<u>Downhill Race</u>**

1. Particle
2. Solid Sphere
3. Solid Cylinder
4. Circular Hoop

*The smaller the number in front the longer it takes.* 

## Angular Momentum

$$L = I\omega = r\times p\sin\theta = rmv\sin\theta$$

It is always perpendicular to the plane

$$\tau = \frac{dL}{dt}$$, the total L is always conserved

**Static Equilibrium**: an extended object that is completely stationary

$$\theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{t}{2h}\right)$$

## Rotational Energy

$$K_{rot} = \frac12m_1v_2^2 + \frac12m_2v_2^2+\ldots$$

An object's moment of inertia depends on the axis of rotation.

$$K_{rot} = \frac12 I\omega^2$$
